## Information About the APP

```
The app we are developing is a step-by-step explanation of acheiving one's goals. We are using the assistance 
of an all-knowing AI to generate the step-by-step process that helps explain what needs to be done in order 
to achieve those goals. When the users enter the homepage of the app, they will be presented with the homepage 
that explains what is the purposes of this app and there will also be in the header where the users can navigate 
to the signup/login page. Once the users enter the signup/login page, then they will have to signup/login with 
their email and password. After signing in or logging in, the users will be taken to goal page where it will show
a list of their goals in progress and completed goals. If the users have not set up any goals or want to add new 
goals, then the users can click the add-goal option in the header and it will take them to the add-goal page where
they can learn the step-by-step proces of achieving that goal that is generated by the all-knowing AI.
